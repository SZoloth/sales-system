## DENISE DRESSER - CEO, SLACK

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (TLDR)**
Accountant-turned-executive with 12+ years at Salesforce, now tasked with stabilizing Slack after turbulent leadership transitions. Analytical, questioning mindset with collaborative approach seeking to balance growth recovery with cultural integration.

**THE GAME BEING PLAYED**
Dresser operates in a complex multi-stakeholder environment: reporting to Marc Benioff while managing Slack's declining growth trajectory (from 46% to 16% YoY), integrating with Salesforce ecosystem, and maintaining employee morale after leadership churn. The game requires simultaneous culture preservation and transformation.

**RIDER VS. ELEPHANT ANALYSIS**

**CONSCIOUS NARRATIVE & CORE DRIVES**
- **Stated Mission**: Bringing stability to Slack while accelerating Salesforce integration
- **Core Drives**: Achievement through analytical problem-solving, mentorship of others (especially women), systematic organizational improvement
- **Deep Motivations**: Proving capability as external appointment; creating lasting impact beyond just financial metrics

**OCEAN BIG FIVE SNAPSHOT**
- **Openness**: Medium-High (75% confidence) - Open to new approaches but grounded in proven methods
- **Conscientiousness**: High (90% confidence) - Accounting background + systematic approach to questioning
- **Extraversion**: Medium (70% confidence) - Collaborative but comfortable working behind scenes
- **Agreeableness**: High (80% confidence) - Collaborative leadership style, mentorship focus
- **Neuroticism**: Low-Medium (65% confidence) - Stable under pressure but facing significant challenges

**MBTI TYPE HYPOTHESIS**
ISFJ - "The Protector" (70% confidence). Strong analytical skills (accounting), collaborative approach, and mentorship passion suggest introverted sensing with feeling decision-making and judging structure.

**ENNEAGRAM TYPE ASSESSMENT**
Type 1 - The Perfectionist with 2 wing (65% confidence). Drive for systematic improvement, questioning approach to find flaws, combined with mentorship and collaborative elements suggesting 2 wing.

**SIGNATURE STRENGTHS & SHADOW WEAKNESSES**
- **Strengths**: Analytical rigor, collaborative leadership, systematic problem-solving, mentorship capability
- **Shadows**: May over-analyze decisions; potential imposter syndrome as third CEO; risk of being too methodical in fast-moving tech environment

**ECOSYSTEM FIT**
Strong fit with Salesforce's analytical culture but must navigate Slack's more empathetic, creative heritage. Well-positioned to bridge cultures but faces significant growth pressure that may force difficult decisions.

**10-ADJECTIVE REFERENCE PROFILE**
Analytical, Collaborative, Methodical, Questioning, Stable, Mentoring, Systematic, Pressure-aware, Detail-oriented, Bridge-building

**PROFESSIONAL HISTORY & INTERESTS**
12+ years at Salesforce in various executive roles, most recently President of Accelerated Industries Sales. University of Massachusetts Amherst accounting background. Passionate about mentoring women leaders and ALS awareness (ALSForce sponsor). Prefers working behind scenes rather than spotlight.

**CONFIDENCE & BIAS ASSESSMENT**
High confidence in analytical capabilities and collaborative style based on consistent evidence. Medium confidence in stress response and strategic vision under pressure. Potential bias toward viewing her through lens of "third CEO challenge" rather than individual capabilities.

**ALTERNATIVE READINGS**
Alternative interpretation: Rather than stability-focused caretaker, Dresser might be a transformation agent specifically chosen to fundamentally reshape Slack's culture and operations for Salesforce integration, with her "questioning" approach being more disruptive than supportive.

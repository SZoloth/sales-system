Pursuit Narrative Arcs: Old Game, New Game
 
Preamble:
This type of pursuit is typically used to frame an opportunity in the clients mind and sometimes happens before we move towards alignment on an SOW with a specific project plan/team size etc.
It gets people over the hump of “do I want to buy” not the specifics behind “what am I buying”.
When a client is seeing the smallest possible version of their opportunity this is a way to position our selves in a more strategic light and increase the engagement size and potential.
Example from past pursuit:
•	Beauty Brand: Reimagining the future of personal care, together.
•	Education Company
1.	Title should portray a seismic shift happening in the clients world 
2.	Make a promise
1.	e.g. Our partnership will will result in your ability to
1.	Manage risk
2.	Become a leader in your industry
3.	Maximize ROI
3.	Set Expectations
1.	Create urgency
2.	Cost of inaction → The status quo is not sustainable
1.	Who is going to win in the new game? Who is behind and going to lose?
2.	Reference comparators, be measurable and quantify outcomes if possible
1.	Example: “In the last 15 years, 52% of fortune 500 companies have disappeared”
4.	Share insights that explain the new game
1.	Paint a picture of what the market will look like if the customer adopts the “new game”
2.	Competitive analysis → Be specific with names of competitors, what they are doing and how we differentiate
3.	Prove a leap frog (if possible)
1.	We don’t want it to look like they are just “catching up”
4.	Show them the biggest possible version of their success
5.	Ideas 
1.	Do this through mock ups, storyboards, prototypes etc - we want to visualize the ideas!
2.	This is specifically what we are proposing is the “new game”
6.	Application
1.	For whom does this apply? Paint the picture of the environment in which this new things lives
2.	Restate the cost of inaction in reference to the ideas presented
7.	Prove it

Pursuit Narrative Arcs: Flip the Script
 
Preamble:
This type of pursuit is typically used to frame an opportunity in the clients mind and sometimes happens before we move towards alignment on an SOW with a specific project plan/team size etc.
It gets people over the hump of “do I want to buy?” not the specifics behind “what am I buying?”
When a client is seeing the smallest possible version of their opportunity, this is a way to position ourselves in a more strategic light and increase the engagement size and potential.
Example from past pursuits: Utility Company: Marketing Campaigns Aren't Enough
The client came to us wanting a primary AOR to manage ad buys, marketing campaigns, etc. We flipped the script to tell them that to achieve their goals, they need customers to undergo behavioral change, and that "marketing campaigns aren't enough."
1.	Title should challenge the ask
2.	Restate the client’s initial request
1.	Potentially reframed as a more natural segue into our proposed approach
2.	Prove understanding of context
3.	Make a promise
1.	e.g. Our partnership will will result in your ability to
1.	Manage risk
2.	Become a leader in your industry
3.	Maximize ROI
4.	Share insights that explain the flip
1.	Competitive analysis
2.	Applied industry trends and themes
1.	e.g. "Legacy platform X is dying…"
5.	Cast a bold vision for the future of
1.	their business
2.	their customers
6.	…and then Visualize it for them
1.	What does this future state actually look and feel like?
7.	Prove it
1.	Share original research
2.	Surface data
8.	Simplify their decision and foster urgency
1.	Tie our fates together
2.	Answer “why us?” and “why now?”
3.	What in this pitch do they want to say ‘yes’ to?
1.	Is there a ‘yes, but…’ or a ‘yes, and…’
